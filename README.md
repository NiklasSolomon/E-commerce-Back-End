# E-commerce-Back-End

## Goal:
The goal of the project is to build a back end application for an e-commerce website. This will show the student's knowledge of MySQL, Sequelize, Express, and API building.
## How:
The database is built by creating models with sequelize for each table to be seeded. Routes are created to indicate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for each model. Insomnia is used to display the functionality.
## Result:
When the user runs mysql and seeds the database using npm run seed, the server can be started and displayed in insomnia. Each model indicating Category, Products, and Tags are shown; each displaying the routes for viewing by all and individual rows, creating new rows, updating existing rows, and deleting existing rows.
